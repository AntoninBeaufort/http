# Introduction

HTTP module for Nuxt.js provides a universal way to make HTTP requests to the API backend.

This module is a successor of [Axios Module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/axios-module) with more than 100K weekly downloads and heavily tested.

Behind the scenes HTTP uses [ky-universal](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky-universal) and [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to make HTTP requests.
